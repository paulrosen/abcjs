Version 1.11
===

Features
---

* Added new entry points: ABCJS.startAnimation() and ABCJS.stopAnimation(), which allow for a bouncing ball-type cursor.

* Added getBeatLength() to the returned tune to get the length of a beat in measures.

* Return the tune object from renderABC() so it can be manipulated further by the caller.

* Put a copy of the engraver with the outputted tune, so that it can be manipulated later.

* Made highlighting notes more flexible: both the class name for the highlight and the note-head color can be specified or not used.

* Added descriptive classes to all SVG elements, including element type, line number, and measure number.

Bugs

AbsoluteElement class.\n\nvar setClass = require('./set-class');\nvar highlight = require(\"./highlight\");\nvar unhighlight = require(\"./unhighlight\");\n\n// Everything that is placed in the SVG is first created as an absolute element. This is one unit of graphic information.\n// That is, it embodies a concept: a clef, a time signature, a bar line,etc. or most complexly:\n// a note with its accidental, grace note, chord symbol, trill, stem, eighth flags, etc.\n// In the largest sense, these are placed on the page at a particular place that is determined during the layout phase.\n// This object doesn't contain any of the drawing information, though. That information is contained in an array of\n// RelativeElements as the \"children\" of this class.\n// During the layout phase, the width of all the children is calculated and the X coordinate of the absolute element is set.\n//\n// So, after the AbsoluteElement is placed, then its children can be placed relative to that. There are different types of\n// relative elements that are placed with different rules:\n// 1) Fixed - these elements don't move relative to the absolute element's coordinates. These are things like the notehead,\n// any ledger lines, accidentals, etc.\n// 2) Slotted - these elements can move vertically and don't get Y coordinates until after the absolute element is placed.\n// These are things like the chord symbol, many decorations, the lyrics, etc.\n//\n// Relative elements are also classified by how they are related. This could be:\n// 1) Increases the absolute element's width to the left. This doesn't change the center point of\n// the absolute element, so adding a sharp to the note won't move it to the right. However, if the elements\n// are close together then this enforces a minimum distance.\n// 2) Has no effect on the width. Annotations and the tempo act like this. No matter how long they are the width doesn't change.\n// 3) Increases the absolute element's width to the right. This doesn't change the center point,\n// but it will increase the minimum distance.\n// 4) Sets the width on both sides. This is the note heads. They are centered on both sides of the absolute element's X coordinate.\n\n// duration - actual musical duration - different from notehead duration in triplets. refer to abcelem to get the notehead duration\n// minspacing - spacing which must be taken on top of the width defined by the duration\n// type is a meta-type for the element. It is not necessary for drawing, but it is useful to make semantic sense of the element. For instance, it can be used in the element's class name.\nvar AbsoluteElement = function AbsoluteElement(abcelem, duration, minspacing, type, tuneNumber, options)

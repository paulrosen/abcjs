This is one unit of graphic information.\n// That is, it embodies a concept: a clef, a time signature, a bar line,etc. or most complexly:\n// a note with its accidental, grace note, chord symbol, trill, stem, eighth flags, etc.\n// In the largest sense, these are placed on the page at a particular place that is determined during the layout phase.\n// This object doesn't contain any of the drawing information, though. That information is contained in an array of\n// RelativeElements as the \"children\" of this class.\n// During the layout phase, the width of all the children is calculated and the X coordinate of the absolute element is set.\n//\n// So, after the AbsoluteElement is placed, then its children can be placed relative to that. There are different types of\n// relative elements that are placed with different rules:\n// 1) Fixed - these elements don't move relative to the absolute element's coordinates. These are things like the notehead,\n// any ledger lines, accidentals, etc.\n// 2) Slotted - these elements can move vertically and don't get Y coordinates until after the absolute element is placed.\n// These are things like the chord symbol, many decorations, the lyrics, etc.\n//\n// Relative elements are also classified by how they are related. This could be:\n// 1) Increases the absolute element's width to the left. This doesn't change the center point of\n// the absolute element, so adding a sharp to the note won't move it to the right. However, if the elements\n// are close together then this enforces a minimum distance.\n// 2) Has no effect on the width. Annotations and the tempo act like this. No matter how long they are the width doesn't change.\n// 3) Increases the absolute element's width to the right. This doesn't change the center point,\n// but it will increase the minimum distance.\n// 4) Sets the width on both sides. This is the note heads. They are centered on both sides of the absolute element's X coordinate.\n\n// duration - actual musical duration - different from notehead duration in triplets. refer to abcelem to get the notehead duration\n// minspacing - spacing which must be taken on top of the width defined by the duration\n// type is a meta-type for the element.

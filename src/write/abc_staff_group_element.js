// StaffGroupElement contains all the elements that go together to make one line of music.
// That might be multiple staves that are tied together, and it might be multiple voices on one staff.
//
// Methods:
// constructor: some basic initialization
// addVoice(): Called once for each voice. May add a new staff if needed.
// finished(): Called only internally by layout()
// layout(): This does all the layout. It sets the following: spacingunits, startx, minspace, w, and the x-coordinate of each element in each voice.
// draw(): Calls the underlying methods on the voice objects to do the drawing. Sets y and height.
//
// Members:
// staffs: an array of all the staves in this group. Each staff contains the following elements:
//    { top, bottom, highest, lowest, y }
// voices: array of VoiceElement objects. This is mostly passed in, but the VoiceElement objects are modified here.
//
// spacingunits: number of relative x-units in the line. Used by the calling function to pass back in as the "spacing" input parameter.
// TODO-PER: This should actually be passed back as a return value.
// minspace: smallest space between two notes. Used by the calling function to pass back in as the "spacing" input parameter.
// TODO-PER: This should actually be passed back as a return value.
// startx: The left edge, taking the margin and the optional voice name. Used by the draw() method.
// w: The width of the line. Used by calling function to pass back in as the "spacing" input parameter, and the draw() method.
// TODO-PER: This should actually be passed back as a return value.  (TODO-PER: in pixels or spacing units?)
// y: The top of the staff group, in pixels. This is set in the draw method.
// TODO-PER: Where is that used? It looks like it might not be needed.
// height: Set in the draw() method to the height actually used. Used by the calling function to know where to start the next staff group.
// TODO-PER: This should actually be set in the layout method and passed back as a return value.

// Most elements on the page are related to a particular absolute element -- notes, rests, bars, etc. Beams, however, span multiple elements.
// This means that beams can't be laid out until the absolute elements are placed. There is the further complication that the stems for beamed
// notes can't be laid out until the beams are because we don't know how long they will be until we know the slope of the beam and the horizontal
// spacing of the absolute elements.
//
// So, when a beam is detected, a BeamElem is created, then all notes belonging to that beam are added to it. These notes are not given stems at that time.
// Then, after the horizontal layout is complete, all of the BeamElem are iterated to set the beam position, then all of the notes that are beamed are given
// stems. After that, we are ready for the drawing step.

// There are three phases: the setup phase, when new elements are being discovered, the layout phase, when everything is calculated, and the drawing phase,
// when the object is not changed, but is used to put the elements on the page.
